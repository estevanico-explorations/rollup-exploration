An example repo where I plan to explore 2 main paths and some other ideas I want to try out.

## Paths
### TypeScript Setup
I'm thinking of this sort of like a template to use to make other `TypeScript` powered libraries using `Rollup`.

#### Expectations
- [x] Uses path aliases
- [ ] Compilation
  - [x] Source to single file
  - [x] Source maps (unless production)
  - [x] Single type definiation file
  - [ ] Optionally export a shell script alongside source
- General configurations
  - [x] Add a `LICENSE` file to header
  - [x] Remove all comments & `console.log` statements
  - [ ] Handles peer deps
- Outputs
  - [x] ES
  - [x] CommonJS
  - [ ] Must test in a different page to confirm
    - i.e. something in an `app/` directory in a macro repo
  - [ ] Create a secondary package that contains the least amount of stuff in it and compress it to a single file (`zip`)
- Development
  - [x] Watches code changes
    - [x] Without `nodemon`
- [ ] Rollup config that ISN'T IN the source directory
  - [ ] Any config that does exist is merged with the automatically provided config 

### Plugin Development
- Auto generates imports for output
  - i.e. No `index.ts` file required
    - If one is provided then it overrides the default code
  - Respects function comment to ignore in the default export; defaults to public
    - i.e. `@@private`, `@@overlook`, `@@dismiss`, `@@noemit`

## Optional Ideas
### Template Generator
Create a generator using whatever template library to create a plugin using my above configurations & requirements to disk. Think [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)

Some interesting packages to look into
- [Yellicode](https://www.yellicode.com/docs/quickstart/)
- [Automating boilerplate code generation](https://dev.to/kapantzak/automating-boilerplate-code-generation-with-node-js-and-handlebars-2c09)
- [Node JS Code Generator](https://dev.to/gokulnathp/boost-your-productivity-with-a-node-js-code-generator-51mk)
  - [GokulnathP/code-generator](https://github.com/GokulnathP/code-generator)
- [jondot/hygen](https://github.com/jondot/hygen)
- [Simple Scaffold](https://chenasraf.github.io/simple-scaffold/) 
  - [chenasraf/simple-scaffold](https://github.com/chenasraf/simple-scaffold)
  - Can it do full projects? (multiple pages & directories)
- [lbagic/scaffold](https://github.com/lbagic/scaffold)

### Publish?
I dunno, if the plugin works as I'd like perhaps publish the plugin maybe?

## TODO
- Production configs
- development configs
- ~~Add a banner~~
- ~~Support versioning~~
- support bin files
- Write a rollup runner that uses it's own configs and no those stored within the codebase
- that auto injector plugin
- a minifier of some sort
- play more with exported types
- a special manifest type of thing
- what types of watch modes are really nessessary?
- metrics & observability
